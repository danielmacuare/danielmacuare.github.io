Well hello there, I’m Daniel and I work as a consultant in the Network Automation space. For the past 5 years, I’ve been extensively working with Cloud and Automation projects.

I love using code to solve complex problems and improve processes.

I’m somewhat obsessed with productivity, and I love reading about better ways to be more efficient and keep improving in all areas of my life. 

When I'm not busy tinkering with Networks and automation, I enjoy traveling, discovering new places, and learning more about life in other countries.
