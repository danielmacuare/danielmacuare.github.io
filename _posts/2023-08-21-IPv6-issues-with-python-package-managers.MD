## TLDR

Installing a Python package was an extremely slow and painful process. I tried using Poetry at first and later switched to PIP. The problem was not related to the tooling as I initially thought. The workaround for this issue was to disable IPv6 only on the interface I was using to route traffic to the internet. I still let IPv6 be enabled on all other interfaces.

## Problem

For a while, I've had some issues while installing python packages only lab server. Installing even 2 or 3 python packages would take at least 3+ minutes.

I was initially using Poetry and later switched to PIP. Although it got slightly better with PIP, the time required to install a package was still ridiculous.

After searching and trying many different things I found the solution to my problem. Note: This is just one of the possible solutions to the slowness in the installation of python packages using tools like PIP or Poetry.

Example from other [users on Github](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/issues/2094#issuecomment-616201046) (Unfortunately I couldn't save a screenshot of my issue and couldn't replicate it after applying the workaround):

## Root Cause

By default, most of the newer Linux OS distros come with IPV6 enabled by default. This means that in some cases when using PIP, Poetry, or some other tools, they will attempt to initiate connections via booth IPv4 and IPv6 and, those connections will eventually timeout or succeed.

### Happy Eyeballs

To efficiently manage both connections (IPv4 and I(Pv6), an algorithm called "Happy Eyeballs 2" (A bit weird of a name if you ask me) has been defined in [RFC 8305](https://www.rfcreader.com/#rfc8305) which deprecated the original [RFC 6555](https://www.rfcreader.com/#rfc6555). The idea is that the server will initiate a connection, usually via IPv6 first, and then after a small delay (typically between 150 - 250 ms. 250 ms is recommended in the RFC), it should then attempt a 2nd connection via IPv4.

**Quotes from the RFC:**

- In order to avoid unreasonable network load, connection attempts SHOULD NOT be made simultaneously. Instead, one connection attempt to a single address is started first.
- Starting a new connection attempt does not affect previous attempts, as multiple connection attempts may occur in parallel.
- Once one of the connection attempts succeeds (generally when the TCP handshake completes), all other connection attempts that have not yet succeeded SHOULD be canceled. Any address that was not yet attempted as a connection SHOULD be ignored. At that time, the asynchronous DNS query MAY be canceled as new addresses will not be used for this connection. However, the DNS client resolver SHOULD still process DNS replies from the network for a short period of time (recommended to be 1 second), as they will populate the DNS cache and can be used for subsequent connections.

**That is the theory at least**. In practice, I couldn't find much information on how Ubuntu 22.04 implements this technique but I suspect that for every python package and every one of its dependencies, an initial connection via IPv6 was attempted and timing out to then fall back to IPv6 (Hopefully concurrently instead of serially).

For this post, I'm going to use Ubuntu 22.04 for the explanation of how to confirm if this is your problem and then to offer a workaround. Below, you can see info on my distro:

### How to check if IPv6 is enabled in your system

Use the command below to check if IPv6 is enabled. If the output returns:

```bash
sysctl -a 2>/dev/null | grep disable_ipv6
```

![IPv6 status Linux](2023-08-21/ipv6-status-linux.webp)
_Figure 3 - IPv6 Enabled (0) on all the interfaces_

- 0 - Means that IPv6 is **Enabled**
- 1 - Means that IPv6 is **Disabled**

### Bonus Point (Create an alias for it)

Since I'm really bad at remembering these kinds of useful commands, I had to create an alias for it.

**Note:** ZSH By default uses the `~/.aliases` file to source your custom aliases every time you open a new shell.

```bash
echo "alias ipv6-status='sysctl -a 2>/dev/null | grep disable_ipv6'" >> ~/.aliases
cat ~/.aliases
source ~/.aliases
alias | grep ipv6
```

If you use `bash` you might want to add your aliases to `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_aliases` instead.

## Workaround

To workaround this issue you can simply disable the interface you use to reach the PyPI (Python Package Index) repos that PIP and Poetry use to fetch python packages.

### Temporarily Disable IPv6 (Only on the interface used to get to PyPI)

```bash
ip route # With this command you will identify what is the exit interface you use to get to the internet (Or to a Local repository if that's your case)

ipv6-status # Alias defined to get the status of all your ipv6 interfaces

sudo sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.ens18.disable_ipv6=1 # Disable IPv6 on the ens18 interface as it is used to route traffic to the internet and fetch packages from PyPI
```

### Test if that fixed your problem by installing some python packages

```bash
poetry add rich nornir nornir_napalm
pip install rich nornir nornir_napalm
```

At this stage, I managed to reduce the installation of 3 packages **from 3+ minutes to less than 1 minute.**

If that has worked for you, congratulations!! You have just now fixed this issue but don't forget to make your change permanent to survive a reboot.

### Permanently Disable IPv6 via Sysctl (Only on the interface used to get to PyPI)

1 - `vim /etc/sysctl.conf`

```bash
net.ipv6.conf.ens18.disable_ipv6=1      # Make sure you modify the name of the interface (ens18 in my case)
```

2 - Apply the changes by issuing the following command in your shell: `sysctl -p`

3 - Make sure that the intended interface has been disabled (After setting it to 1). Use any of the 2 alternatives next but don't forget to modify the name of the interface (if necessary):

```bash
ipv6-status | grep ens18
cat /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/ens18/disable_ipv6
```

4 - Reboot the system if possible to test 

```bash
shutdown -r 02:00 #Â Schedules a reboot at 2:00 AM
shutdown -c # (Optional) to cancel the scheduled shutdown
```

If you have faced this issue, I would love to hear how you solved it
